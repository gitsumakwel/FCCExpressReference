/*
Get Data from POST RequestsPassed

Mount a POST handler at the path /name. Itâ€™s the same path as before.
We have prepared a form in the html frontpage.
It will submit the same data of exercise 10 (Query string).
If the body-parser is configured correctly, you should find the parameters in the object req.body.
Have a look at the usual library example:

    route: POST '/library'
    urlencoded_body: userId=546&bookId=6754
    req.body: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}

Respond with the same JSON object as before: {name: 'firstname lastname'}.
Test if your endpoint works using the html form we provided in the app frontpage.

Tip: There are several other http methods other than GET and POST.
And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb,
and the operation you are going to execute on the server.
The conventional mapping is:

POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,

GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,

PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,

DELETE => Delete a resource.

There are also a couple of other methods which are used to negotiate a connection with the server.
Except from GET, all the other methods listed above can have a payload (i.e. the data into the request body).
The body-parser middleware works with these methods as well.
